    * [X] Create an Invoice class that contains an ArrayList of InvoiceItems and a date
    *       and customer name, address and account number
    *

    *       Name
    *       Price
    *       Quantity
    *       Taxable (TRUE or FALSE)
    *
    *  [X] Implement a loop functionality that allows users to enter in as
    *       many items as they want until the user enters "no" to stop.
    *
    *  [X] Prompt the user for their state. Based on the state they enter,
    *       charge them the following sales tax rates:
    *
    *           * MD - 6.00%
    *           * VA - 5.75%

    *
    *  [X]     Note: Only calculate the sales tax if TAXABLE is set to TRUE for that item.
    *
    *        Calculate the cost for each item(price * quantity)   quantity * item.price = item.total
    *        Calculate the sub-total(the sum of each item's cost)         item.subtotal
    *        Calculate the sales tax(only if taxable is TRUE for the item) if( Taxable == "true"){calc(tax.sum)};
    *        Calculate the total amount(subtotal + sales tax)
    *        Format all decimals to two decimal places. See (Formatting numbers in Canvas)
